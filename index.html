  						<p>The Big Apple! Visiting New York city was one of the first things I ticked off my bucket list. I've always loved watching movies and tv series since young and several movies had New York as its setting. The movie lover inside of me had her dream come true. My favourite TV series of all time is Friends, and I was very excited and glad to have seen the Friends Building in NYC.<br><br>
                Fun fact: I  almost went to New York University for my
                undergradate studies. </p>

I visited with my friends from college and we were very lucky that we saw the place at a quiet time. What a peaceful and beautiful place to visit. After being the states for some time, I found out from the locals here that deers are almost as common as birds! Especially along the roads as you drive the long road trips around the country. (This is surprising because you hardly see deers in Singapore.)
